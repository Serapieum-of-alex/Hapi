Zonal Statistics
########

one of the most frequent used function in geospatial analysis is zonal statistics, where you overlay a shapefile contains some polygons with some maps and you want each polygon to extract the values that locates inside it from the map, `raster` module in `Hapi` contains a similar function `OverlayMap` where you can convert the polygon shapefile into a raster first and use it as a base map to overlay with other maps

You don't need to copy and paste the code in this page you can find it in the examples ([Zonal Statistics](https://github.com/MAfarrag/Hapi/blob/master/Examples/GIS/ZonalStatistics.py))

OverlayMap one map
-----------------------------------

The `OverlayMap` function takes two ascii files the `BaseMap` which is the raster/asc file of the polygons and the secon is the asc file you want to extract its values. 

``
def OverlayMap(Path, BaseMap, ExcludeValue, Compressed = False, OccupiedCellsOnly=True):
"""
=================================================================
    (Path, BaseMap, ExcludeValue, Compressed = False, OccupiedCellsOnly=True)
=================================================================
this function is written to extract and return a list of all the values
in an ASCII file

Inputs:
    1-Path:
        [String] a path to ascii file (inclusing the extension).
    2-BaseMap:
        [String/array] a path includng the name of the ASCII/raster and extention like BaseMap="data/cropped.asc".
    3-ExcludedValue:
        [Numeric] values you want to exclude from extracted values.
    4-Compressed:
        [Bool] if the map you provided is compressed.
    5-OccupiedCellsOnly:
        [Bool] if you want to count only cells that is not zero.
Outputs:
    1- ExtractedValues:
        [Dict] dictonary with a list of values in the basemap as keys
            and for each key a list of all the intersected values in the
            maps from the path.
    2- NonZeroCells:
        [dataframe] dataframe with the first column as the "file" name
        and the second column is the number of cells in each map.
"""
``
To extract the 
``
import Hapi.raster as R


Path = "F:/02Case studies/Hapi Examples/"
SavePath  = Path + "results/ZonalStatistics"
BaseMapF = Path + "data/Polygons.tif"
ExcludedValue = 0
Compressed = True
OccupiedCellsOnly = False

ExtractedValues, Cells = R.OverlayMap(Path+"DepthMax22489.zip", BaseMapF,ExcludedValue, Compressed,OccupiedCellsOnly)
``

OverlayMap Several maps
===================
The `OverlayMaps` function takes path to the folder where more than one map exist instead of a path to one file, it also takes an extra parameter `FilePrefix`, this prefix is used to name the files in the given path and all the file has to start with the prefix

```
FilePrefix = "Map"
# several maps
ExtractedValues, Cells = R.OverlayMaps(Path+"data", BaseMapF, FilePrefix,ExcludedValue, Compressed,OccupiedCellsOnly)
```
both methods `OverlayMap` and `OverlayMaps` returns the values as a `dict`, the difference is in the number of cells `OverlayMaps` returns a single integer number while `OverlayMap` returns a `dataframe` with two columns the first in the map name and the second is the number of occupied cell in each map.

Save extracted values 
===================
```
# save extracted values in different files
Polygons = list(ExtractedValues.keys())
for i in range(len(Polygons)):
    np.savetxt(SavePath +"/" + str(Polygons[i]) + ".txt",
               ExtractedValues[Polygons[i]],fmt="%4.2f")
```
