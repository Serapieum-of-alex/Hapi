in case you want to manipulate the value in all the rasters of one of the inputs

"How can evaporation have both positive and negative values?
Evaporation is normally negative due to the convention for fluxes.
The meteorological convention for all vertical fluxes is that downwards is positive.
Positive evaporation represents condensation'.
