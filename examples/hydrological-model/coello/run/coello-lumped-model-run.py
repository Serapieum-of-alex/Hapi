"""Lumped model with Muskingum routing, built from YAML.

Everything that used to be a "Paths" block of hardcoded assignments now lives in
`coello-lumped-model-run.yaml`, next to this script -- `Catchment.from_yaml` reads it and
assembles the model. Running it stays here, as in any hand-wired script: the routing function is
a run-time choice rather than an input, so it is picked below and handed to `Run.run_lumped`.

Lumped mode reads one CSV of catchment-average drivers instead of a grid, and one discharge file
instead of a gauge table plus a folder -- see the config for both.

The path is written from the repo root, so run this script from there:
`python examples/hydrological-model/coello/run/coello-lumped-model-run.py`.
