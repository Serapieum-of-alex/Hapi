"""Tests for ``MeteoInputs``, which owns the model's meteorological drivers.

The three loaders must be interchangeable: a distributed Muskingum run driven from folders of
rasters, from one NetCDF per variable, or from a single NetCDF holding all three, has to produce
the same discharge. That equivalence is the whole point of the structure, so it is asserted
against the raster-driven run that ``test_extract_discharge_distributed`` already exercises.
