"""Tests for the parameter-count validation and the temporal-resolution branches of Catchment.

`read_parameters` accepts a directory of rasters (or a CSV in lumped mode) and then checks the
count against the snow/maxbas combination the caller declared. The count is what the conceptual
model indexes by position, so a wrong one does not raise inside HBV — it reads the wrong
parameter — which is why the guard is worth pinning per combination.

            The columns are read by position, so a file with a different count cannot be
            interpreted and must be refused rather than silently mapped.
