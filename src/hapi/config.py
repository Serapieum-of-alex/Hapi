"""The schema of a YAML run configuration.

This module describes data and nothing else: `RunConfig` and the blocks it nests validate a
parsed YAML mapping and hold the result. It imports nothing from `hapi`, which keeps it a leaf
of the import graph and lets `hapi.catchment` import it at module level. Reading the file and
building a model out of it -- the `Catchment` construction, the `MeteoInputs` / `FlowNetwork`
loaders, the `read_*` call order -- belongs to :meth:`hapi.catchment.Catchment.from_yaml`.

The schema covers lumped and distributed runs, which disagree on the shape of two blocks:

- `meteo`: a grid for distributed (raster folders or NetCDF, per `source`), and a single CSV of
  catchment-average drivers for lumped.
- `gauges`: a gauge table plus a folder of per-gauge discharge files for distributed, and one
  discharge file with no table for lumped.

Which fields are required therefore depends on `catchment.spatial_resolution` and, for a
distributed run, on `meteo.source`. Those cross-field rules are enforced here by model
validators, so the builder can consume a validated `RunConfig` without re-deriving them. Two
things are still left to it, because neither can be settled from the file alone: resolving
`conceptual_model.model_class` against the registry of model classes, and checking that the
paths exist. `Catchment.from_yaml` does both before it opens anything.

The same dependency decides which fields are *refused*: a field the chosen shape never reads is
rejected rather than dropped. `extra="forbid"` already does that for a misspelled key, and a
correctly spelled but inapplicable one is the same mistake -- a line in the file with no effect
-- so it fails the same way. Only fields written explicitly count, so defaults are never held
against an author.

Out of scope, each because the schema carries no field that reaches it:

- Lake-aware runs (`hapi.catchment.Lake`) and the flood model (`Run.run_flood`), which need
  a lake record and a river geometry respectively -- so `read_river_geometry` is unreachable.
- `read_flow_path_length`, and with it `route_maxbas_by_path_length`, which scales each cell's MAXBAS by its
  distance to the outlet.
- Reading a driver folder by numeric file order rather than by date. `MeteoConfig` has no
  `date` field, so `date=False` can only be reached through `per_variable` -- where it now
  meets the catchment window this schema always passes down, and `read_rasters` refuses the
  combination.

Examples:
    - Validate a lumped configuration and read back what it holds:
        ```python
        >>> from hapi.config import RunConfig
        >>> config = RunConfig.model_validate(
        ...     {
        ...         "catchment": {
        ...             "name": "Coello",
        ...             "start": "2009-01-01",
        ...             "end": "2011-12-31",
        ...         },
        ...         "meteo": {"path": "meteo_data.csv"},
        ...         "parameters": {"path": "parameters.txt"},
        ...         "conceptual_model": {
        ...             "model_class": "HBVBergestrom92",
        ...             "catchment_area": 1530,
        ...             "initial_condition": [0, 10, 10, 10, 0],
        ...         },
        ...         "gauges": {"discharge": "Qout_c.csv"},
        ...     }
        ... )
        >>> config.catchment.spatial_resolution
        'lumped'
        >>> config.conceptual_model.catchment_area
        1530.0
        >>> config.gauges.fmt
        '%Y-%m-%d'

        ```
    - A distributed run needs a routing network, so one without it is refused:
        ```python
        >>> from pydantic import ValidationError
        >>> from hapi.config import RunConfig
        >>> try:
        ...     RunConfig.model_validate(
        ...         {
        ...             "catchment": {
        ...                 "name": "Coello",

        ...             "gauges": {"discharge": "Qout_c.csv"},
        ...         }
        ...     )
        ... except ValidationError as error:
        ...     print(error.errors()[0]["msg"])
