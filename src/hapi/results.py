"""The arrays a model run produces, the routing that produced them, and how to view them.

Running a model used to leave its output as nine separate attributes on the
:class:`~hapi.catchment.Catchment` it was handed, with a private boolean recording which
routing scheme had written them. That made a catchment's state unknowable between runs --
the fields of a finished run and the fields of a half-finished one look the same -- and it
put the interpretation of the arrays (`_maxbas_routed`) on the input object rather than on
the arrays themselves.

:class:`SimulationResults` holds them together instead, with the routing scheme as a field.
A run assigns one to `Catchment.results`, and that is the only place the arrays live -- read
them as `model.results.q_total`. The catchment carries no result attributes of its own.

It also renders and writes them. :meth:`~SimulationResults.animate`,
:meth:`~SimulationResults.save_animation` and :meth:`~SimulationResults.save` used to sit on
`Catchment` -- around three hundred lines of matplotlib, cleopatra and pyramids on the object
whose job is to *assemble inputs*, and the only reason a builder imported a plotting stack at
all. They read result arrays and the run that produced them and touch nothing a catchment
alone holds, so they live here, beside the arrays they render.

`Catchment.plot_hydrograph` deliberately stayed behind: it reads no result array at all. It
compares `Qsim` against the observed gauge record, which is an analysis input this object has
no claim to.

    """The arrays one model run produced, the routing that produced them, and their views.

    Built by the run layer and assigned to `Catchment.results`. Mutable, because the run
    fills it in stages: the per-cell model writes :attr:`quz`, :attr:`qlz` and
    :attr:`state_variables`, and the routing step then adds the routed fields and sets
    :attr:`routing`.

    Attributes:
        routing: Which scheme routed these arrays. See :class:`RoutingKind`.
        quz: `(rows, cols, time)` upper-zone discharge in m3/s. For a lumped run, a 1D series.
        qlz: `(rows, cols, time)` lower-zone discharge in m3/s. For a lumped run, a 1D series.
        state_variables: `(rows, cols, time, 5)` state array, the states being
            `[sp, sm, uz, lz, wc]`. For a lumped run, `(time, 5)`. `None` when a distributed
            run was asked not to keep them -- it is five times the size of every other field
            put together and nothing but :meth:`save` and :meth:`animate` reads it, so a run
            that will not look at it need not pay for it. See
            :attr:`~hapi.runs.DistributedRun.keep_state_variables`.
        quz_routed: Upper-zone discharge after routing. `None` until a routing step runs.
        qlz_translated: Lower-zone discharge after translation. `None` until then.
        q_total: `quz_routed + qlz_translated`. Read it through
            :attr:`outlet_shortcut_valid` rather than assuming what a cell means.
        qout: The outlet hydrograph, when the run computed one. The MAXBAS paths sum over the
            domain and set it directly; the Muskingum paths leave it `None` for
            :meth:`~hapi.catchment.Catchment.extract_discharge` to read off the outlet cell,
            which needs the gauge table the engine does not have.
        run: The validated inputs these arrays came from, carried as provenance. It is what
            makes the arrays interpretable on their own: the calendar to index them by, the
            grid to mask them with, and the drivers the animation options can show beside
            them. `None` only for a results object built by hand rather than by a run, in
            which case the presentation methods say so rather than failing on `None`.
        anim: The animation :meth:`animate` last built, or `None`. Not a constructor
            argument.

    Examples:
        - A freshly run, unrouted set knows it is not yet interpretable at the outlet:
            ```python
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from hapi.results import RoutingKind, SimulationResults
            >>> cube = np.zeros((2, 3, 4), dtype="float32")
            >>> results = SimulationResults(
            ...     routing=RoutingKind.UNROUTED, quz=cube, qlz=cube,
            ...     state_variables=np.zeros((2, 3, 4, 5), dtype="float32"),
            ... )
            >>> results.routing.value
            'unrouted'
            >>> results.q_total is None
            True

            ```
        - The outlet-cell shortcut is valid under Muskingum and not under MAXBAS:
            ```python
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from hapi.results import RoutingKind, SimulationResults
            >>> cube = np.zeros((2, 3, 4), dtype="float32")
            >>> states = np.zeros((2, 3, 4, 5), dtype="float32")
            >>> muskingum = SimulationResults(
            ...     RoutingKind.MUSKINGUM, cube, cube, states
            ... )
            >>> maxbas = SimulationResults(RoutingKind.MAXBAS, cube, cube, states)
            >>> muskingum.outlet_shortcut_valid, maxbas.outlet_shortcut_valid
            (True, False)

            ```
        - Arrays with no run behind them say what is missing rather than failing on `None`:
            ```python
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> from hapi.results import RoutingKind, SimulationResults
            >>> cube = np.zeros((2, 3, 4), dtype="float32")
