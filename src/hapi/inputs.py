"""Rainfall-runoff inputs.

Everything the distributed model is driven by, and the loaders that build it:

* `MeteoInputs` -- the three meteorological drivers (precipitation, temperature,
  evapotranspiration) as aligned `(rows, cols, time)` cubes, from folders of dated rasters,
  one NetCDF per variable, or a single NetCDF holding all three.
* `FlowNetwork` -- the routing network (flow accumulation, flow direction, the direction
  table) and the grid it defines, from the accumulation and direction rasters.
* `Inputs` -- preparation utilities: aligning rasters to a source DEM, extracting HBV
  parameters from the global datasets, and building lumped inputs from distributed ones.
* `read_rasters` -- the shared adapter over `DatasetCollection.from_files` that decides the
  order a folder's rasters are handed over in.

Rasters are read in chronological order by `DatasetCollection.from_files`, which parses the
date out of each file name, so the files themselves never need renaming on disk.

The module relies on the `pyramids` library for raster I/O and manipulation, and uses the
`HAPI_DATA_DIR` environment variable to locate pre-downloaded global parameter sets
(Beck et al., 2016).

    r"""Read a folder of rasters into a `DatasetCollection` in the right order.

    A thin adapter over :meth:`DatasetCollection.from_files` -- pyramids does every bit of the
    resolving and reading; this only decides the order the files are handed over in, and
    translates Hapi's string/int `start` / `end` into what `from_files` accepts.

    Three orderings are supported, matching Hapi's public reader arguments:

    * **By date** (`date=True`) -- delegated wholesale to
      `from_files(date_format=..., date_regex=...)`, which sorts and builds the time axis.
      When no `file_name_data_fmt` is given it is inferred from the first name `regex_string`
      matches, so the default ordering is chronological rather than lexicographic.
    * **By number** (`date=False`) -- for names carrying a plain index, e.g.
      `01_Par_RFCF.tif` or `1000_Temp_..._1981_9_27.tif`. `from_files` sorts only by date, and
      its default order is lexicographic, which puts `10_` before `2_` whenever the index is
      not zero-padded. So the files are resolved through `from_files`, sorted on the integer in
      each name, and handed back to `from_files` as an explicit sequence -- which it keeps in
      the given order.
    * **Unordered** -- only when `date=True` and the layout cannot be inferred (an ambiguous
      day-first/month-first date, or a regex that matches no name). Both warn.

    Args:
        path: Folder holding the rasters.
        glob: :mod:`fnmatch` pattern selecting them. Defaults to `"*.tif"`.
        regex_string: Where the date (or the index, when `date=False`) sits in each name.
        date: Whether the matched value is a date. `False` selects the numeric ordering.
        file_name_data_fmt: `strptime` format of the date in the names. Inferred from the
            names themselves when omitted; pass it for a layout that cannot be told apart
            from the digits alone, such as a day-first `03.02.1990`.
        start: Inclusive lower bound -- a date string parsed with `fmt`, or an integer index
            when `date=False`.
        end: Inclusive upper bound; see `start`.
        fmt: `strptime` format of `start` / `end` when they are date strings.
        gdal_env: GDAL configuration options applied for the read, e.g.
            `{"GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN": "EMPTY_DIR"}`. GDAL lists the directory on
            every open to look for sidecars, which on network storage is a remote listing
            per raster -- 369 ms against 18 ms in one measurement over 14,823 files. Left
            unset by default because disabling it also stops GDAL finding `.aux.xml`,
            world files and `.ovr`, which some of this repository's fixtures rely on.

    Returns:
        DatasetCollection: The collection, ordered as described above.

        FileNotFoundError: The folder does not exist, matched no file, or `start` / `end`

    Each field is a `(rows, cols, time)` array — cell first, time last — which is the layout
    :class:`~hapi.catchment.Catchment` and the conceptual models index. The three cubes must
    agree on all three axes; that is checked on construction, because a silent mismatch surfaces
    much later as a confusing index error inside the run loop.

    No-data cells are carried through **as stored**, not converted to NaN. The distributed model
    takes its domain from the flow-accumulation raster rather than from the meteorological
    no-data mask, so masking here would change what the run sees.

    Build one with whichever classmethod matches how the data is stored:

    * :meth:`from_rasters` -- three folders of date-stamped rasters (the historical layout).
    * :meth:`from_netcdf_files` -- one NetCDF per variable.
    * :meth:`from_netcdf` -- a single NetCDF holding all three as separate variables.

    Attributes:
        precipitation: `(rows, cols, time)` rainfall cube.
        temperature: `(rows, cols, time)` temperature cube.
        evapotranspiration: `(rows, cols, time)` potential-evapotranspiration cube.
        time: Optional calendar axis, one entry per timestep. Carried for reference and for
            cross-checking against the model's own date index; the run itself is positional.

        - From three folders of rasters:

            evapotranspiration: Folder of evapotranspiration rasters.
            per_variable: Per-folder overrides, keyed by driver name, applied over the
                shared arguments for that folder only. Needed when the three folders come
                from different sources, which the documented download workflow produces:
                CHIRPS names its rainfall `..._2009.01.01.tif` while ERA5 names its
                temperature `..._20090101.tif`, and no single `regex_string` finds the date
                in both. Its inner keys are the reader arguments below.
            glob: :mod:`fnmatch` pattern selecting the rasters. Defaults to `"*.tif"`.
            regex_string: Where the date sits in each file name.
            date: Whether the matched value is a date. `False` orders by a plain index.
            file_name_data_fmt: `strptime` format of the date. Inferred from the names when
                omitted; pass it for a layout the digits cannot settle, such as a day-first
                `03.02.1990`.
            start: Inclusive lower bound, to read a window rather than the whole folder.
            end: Inclusive upper bound; see `start`.
            fmt: `strptime` format of `start` / `end`.
            gdal_env: GDAL configuration applied for the reads, e.g.
                `{"GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN": "EMPTY_DIR"}` to skip the per-open
                directory listing on network storage.

        The dispatch behind a `meteo` block of a YAML run configuration: `"rasters"` reads three

        whose variables the block names. `hapi.config.RunConfig` has already checked that the
        fields the chosen source needs are set, so this calls the loader directly.

        Each bound is parsed with the format it was written in -- `config.fmt` for a bound the
        block states, `fmt` for one inherited from the caller -- and handed on as a `datetime`.
        The two formats are independent fields, so parsing an inherited bound with the block's
        format would either fail loudly or, between two mutually parseable layouts such as
        `"%d-%m-%Y"` and `"%m-%d-%Y"`, silently window the drivers to the wrong period.

            config: The `meteo` block of a distributed configuration.

            end: Window end used when `config.end` is unset. `None` leaves it open.
            fmt: `strptime` format of `start` / `end`, the inherited bounds. Bounds stated by
                the block are parsed with `config.fmt` instead.

                `path` for `source="netcdf"`. `RunConfig` rejects such a configuration, so this

        A folder of per-date GeoTIFFs is what the download backends produce, and it is the

        the calendar travels inside the file instead of living in the file names.

        The rasters are ordered by :func:`read_rasters`, whose reader arguments are repeated

            date: Whether the matched value is a date. `False` orders by a plain index

            file_name_data_fmt: `strptime` format of the date. Inferred from the names when

        The 18 HBV parameters are:
        `tt, rfcf, sfcf, cfmax, cwh, cfr, fc, beta, etf, lp, k0, k1, k2, uzl, perc, maxbas, K_muskingum, x_muskingum`.

        Args:
            gdf: The catchment polygon, as a
                :class:`~pyramids.feature.FeatureCollection`. Any `GeoDataFrame` is
                accepted too and is wrapped on the way in. Must contain one row; merge
                all polygons first if the shapefile has multiple features. Ignored (and
                may be `None`) when `as_raster` is True.
            scenario: Name of the parameter set. One of `"1"` through
                `"10"`, `"avg"`, `"max"`, or `"min"`.
            as_raster: If True, save aligned parameter rasters to
                `save_to` instead of returning statistics. Default is
                False.
            save_to: Path to the directory where aligned parameter rasters
                will be saved. Only used when `as_raster` is True.

        Returns:
            pandas.DataFrame: When `as_raster` is False, a DataFrame
                indexed by parameter name with columns `"min"`,
                `"max"`, `"mean"`, and `"std"`. Returns None when
                `as_raster` is True.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the `HAPI_DATA_DIR` environment variable is
                not set.
            FileNotFoundError: If the parameter data directory does not
                exist.

        r"""Create lumped inputs by averaging distributed raster values.

        Reads a time series of rasters from the given directory, computes
        the spatial mean of each raster, and returns the averages as a
        list. This is used to convert distributed meteorological or
        parameter data into lumped (catchment-average) values.

        Args:
            path: Path to the folder containing the raster files.
            regex_string: A regex pattern to locate the date (or ordering
                number) within each file name. Default is
                `r"\\d{4}.\\d{2}.\\d{2}"`.
            date: If True, the number extracted from file names is
                interpreted as a date. Default is True.
            file_name_data_fmt: The date format string matching dates in
                the file names (e.g., `"%Y.%m.%d"`). Default is None.
            start: Start date to filter the rasters. If not provided, all
                rasters in the directory are read.
            end: End date to filter the rasters. If not provided, all
                rasters in the directory are read.
            fmt: Format of the `start` and `end` date strings.
                Default is `"%Y-%m-%d"`.
            extension: File extension to filter by. Default is `".tif"`.

        Returns:
            list: The spatial mean of each raster, in chronological order. The elements
                are NumPy scalars (`numpy.float32` for a float32 source) rather than
                built-in `float`, since they come straight from the per-raster
                statistics; wrap them in `float()` if a built-in is required.

        Examples:
            - Reduce two dated rasters to one catchment average each, in date order:
                ```python
                >>> import numpy as np, os, tempfile

                ...     Dataset.create_from_array(
                ...         np.full((2, 2), value, dtype="float32"),

                [2.0, 4.0]

                ```
            - A uniform raster averages to its own value:
